How do I install `ccat`?
--------------------------
Just `brew tap jingweno/ccat` and then `brew install ccat`. If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install jingweno/ccat/ccat`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/jingweno/homebrew-ccat/master/ccat.rb
```

`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew).
